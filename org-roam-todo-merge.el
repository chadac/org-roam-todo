;;; org-roam-todo-merge.el --- Per-project merge/approval workflows for TODO worktrees -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file is part of org-roam-todo.

;;; Commentary:

;; Provides per-project customizable merge workflows for TODO worktrees.
;; Two built-in workflows:
;;
;; 1. `local-rebase' - For repos managed locally (e.g. claude-agent itself):
;;    - Rebase worktree branch onto latest main
;;    - Open magit-status for review
;;    - Fast-forward merge into main
;;    - Clean up worktree + branch
;;
;; 2. `github-pr' - For GitHub-based repos:
;;    - Fetch upstream and rebase onto default branch
;;    - Push and open magit-status for review
;;    - Create PR via forge or gh CLI
;;    - Clean up worktree + branch after merge
;;
;; Configure per-project via `org-roam-todo-merge-workflows' or
;; `.dir-locals.el' with `org-roam-todo-merge-workflow'.
