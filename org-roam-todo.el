;;; Commentary:

;; Org-roam based TODO management with optional Claude integration.
;;
;; This provides a simple workflow:
;; 1. Create a TODO node for a project: `org-roam-todo-capture' (C-c n t t)
;; 2. From the TODO node, choose how to execute:
;;    - `org-roam-todo-send-to-main' (C-c c t) - Send to main session
;;    - `org-roam-todo-create-worktree' (C-c c w) - Create worktree + new session
;;    - `org-roam-todo-start-claude' (C-c n t c) - Start Claude on selected TODO
;; 3. View all TODOs: `org-roam-todo-list' (C-c n t l)
;;
;; TODO nodes are stored in org-roam as: projects/{project}/todo-{slug}.org
;; with properties:
;;   :PROJECT_NAME: short project name
;;   :PROJECT_ROOT: full path to project
;;   :STATUS: draft | active | done | rejected
;;   :WORKTREE_MODEL: model alias or full name (e.g. opus, sonnet, haiku, default)
;;   :WORKTREE_PATH: (set when worktree is created)
;;   :WORKTREE_BRANCH: (set when worktree is created)
